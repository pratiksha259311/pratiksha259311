Hi, I’m Pratiksha — Data Analyst with a strong focus on business, product, and operational analytics.

I focus on practical analytics — not just models, but decisions

I work with SQL, Python, and BI tools to transform raw, unstructured data into meaningful insights that support real-world decision-making.

My work includes:
- Building end-to-end analytical projects (data cleaning → analysis → visualization → insights)
- Analyzing transactional and operational datasets to identify trends, risks, and inefficiencies
- Designing KPIs and dashboards for business and product use-cases

I bring hands-on experience from:
- Independent data analytics projects
- Hackathon-built applications
- 8+ years of exposure to real-world business operations in a family-owned venture

Featured projects (Live demos — using sample or anonymized data):
- BIMSHI – Business analytics application for operational and pricing insights
